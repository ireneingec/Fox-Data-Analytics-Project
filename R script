#Analysation:
#     In 2015, Hongkong has the highest number of Financial Technology adoption of 29%.
#     Whilst in 2017, UK has the highest number of Financial Technology adoption of 42% 
#     and the number of percentage rised to 71% and UK has maintained its position to be
#     the highest number of Financial Technology adoption in 2019

#Find the minimum no.of adoption in 2015,2017,2019
by(FinTechno, FinTechno[2], function(df)df[which.min(df[,3]),])
#Analysation:
#    In 2015, Canada rank the lowest for Financial Technology adoption which was only 8% as well as 
#    in 2017. Although the number of Financial Technology adoption in Canada has rised, Canada still
#    in the lowest position of Financial Technology adoption. In 2019, suprisingly, US has the lowest 
#    of Financial Technology adoption among the other countries.
